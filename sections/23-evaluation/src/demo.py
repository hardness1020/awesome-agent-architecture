"""Section 23 demo: one graded episode inside an evaluation environment.

The environment holds the orders and the balance, and its two tools are the
only way to change them. A simulated user opens with a vague complaint and
releases the order number only when the agent asks, so the model has to run
the conversation, not read the task off the first message.

run_turn is unchanged (section 1): the model plays the agent, its tool calls
land in the environment, and the harness grades the final state, what the
agent said, and how many calls it took. Repeats, Pass^k, and the paired
comparison of two builds are offline checks in test.py.
