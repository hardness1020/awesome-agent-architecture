"""Observability & evaluation (section 20): watch it and measure it.

Two separable pipelines, neither of which touches the loop's control flow.

Telemetry runs inline. emit() is fire-and-forget: events queue until a sink
attaches (the loop can log before telemetry is ready), then each event is
sampled, scrubbed of sensitive fields, and fanned out to every sink. It never
blocks and never raises, so a logging fault cannot stall or crash the loop
(section 1).

CostTracker accumulates per-model token usage into a running USD total, the
number surfaced live and on exit.

run_eval() runs off the hot path: replay a fixed task set against a candidate
build and grade each output, so a quiet quality regression is caught before
users hit it. Telemetry says what happened; only eval says whether it was good.

Mirrors Claude Code services/analytics/: index.ts queues logEvent then drains
on attachAnalyticsSink, shouldSampleEvent drops by rate, the
_I_VERIFIED_THIS_IS_NOT_CODE_OR_FILEPATHS marker guards sensitive fields, and
cost-tracker.ts / modelCost.ts roll per-model token cost into a session total.
